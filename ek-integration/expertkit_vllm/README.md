# Expert Kit integration for vLLM

This package replaces vLLM's routed MoE factory with an implementation that
keeps vLLM's router and shared experts local while sending one complete routed
layer to Expert Kit Transport. It targets vLLM `0.25.1` exactly.

Runtime qualification is deferred during the Python Worker migration. The
current code is version-pinned, and its configuration and registration have
unit tests. The supported Qwen text-generation smoke test uses the Torch
integration.

## Install

Install `expertkit-transport` from this repository first, then install this
package:

```bash
pip install -e ../../ek-transport
pip install -e .
```

## Configure

The plugin is disabled unless `EK_ENABLE=1` is set. When enabled, it reads:

- `EK_ADDR`: Controller gRPC endpoint. The default is `localhost:5002`.
- `EK_INSTANCE_ID`: required positive numeric model instance ID.
- `EK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`: positive timeout in seconds. The default is `6`.

For example:

```bash
export EK_ENABLE=1
export EK_ADDR=controller.internal:5002
export EK_INSTANCE_ID=1
export EK_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=6
```

The Controller and Workers must already be running, and the instance's expert
weights must be ready before inference starts. The MVP assumes a trusted,
isolated cluster network and does not provide TLS or application authentication.
Each Worker registers its Transport type and the Controller publishes it in
topology; the plugin does not select a Transport through an environment
variable. Shared memory requires vLLM and the Worker to use the same Host,
`/dev/shm` namespace, and Unix user.

## Current limits

- Routed experts must use the unquantized SiLU FFN path.
- Tensor, expert, sequence, prefill-context parallelism and EPLB are rejected.
- Pipeline and ordinary data-parallel model processes are allowed.
- Full CUDA Graph capture is changed to piecewise capture because remote MoE
  calls perform network I/O between graph segments.
- The integration depends on vLLM internal interfaces and therefore stays
  pinned until a later version is reviewed and adapted.

The plugin preserves vLLM's model router, including grouped or custom routing,
and sends final `int32` expert assignments and FP32 routing weights through
`expertkit-transport`. Transport returns the weighted, aggregated activation
Tensor to the vLLM layer.

## Four-uBatch Expert pipeline

The optional Expert Kit pipeline lets a vLLM uBatch suspend on the asynchronous
Transport Future while another ready uBatch runs Attention and routing. Install
the versioned vLLM patch before enabling it:

```bash
python scripts/apply_vllm_pipeline_patch.py --apply
python scripts/apply_vllm_pipeline_patch.py --check
export EK_PIPELINE_ENABLE=1
```

Construct `LLM` with `enforce_eager=True`, `ubatch_size=4`, and both DBO
thresholds set to zero. Do not also pass `enable_dbo=True`. The batch must be a
uniform decode batch with at least four requests; other batches retain the
compatible blocking behavior.

Python Worker concurrency is controlled by
`worker.max_active_batches_per_device`, not `EK_WORKER_THREADS`. See
[`doc/ae-dbo-python-worker-pipeline.md`](../../doc/ae-dbo-python-worker-pipeline.md)
for the architecture, patch lifecycle, configuration, and correctness tests.
